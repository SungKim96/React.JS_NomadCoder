React JS - A library that makes applications highly interactive. It serves as an engine.
React-dom - A library or package that allows you to place all React elements into the HTML body.
ReactDOM.render() - The meaning of "render" is to take React elements and convert them into HTML to be placed. In other words, it means displaying them to the user.
ReactDOM.render(span, location where span should go)
-> So, it's common to create an element with id="root" in the body, and then place the span inside the root element.

React.createElement("span", { properties of the span }, "content of the span")
-> Properties can include class names, IDs, and even styles.
-> Just a reference, no need to memorize. You won't typically use it this way.

In Vanilla JS, the order is HTML -> JS.
In React, the order is JS -> HTML.

JS creates elements, and React JS translates them into HTML.
React JS can update the HTML that needs to be updated.
