# Making Movie App with React (Nomad Coder)
<h2>Purpose/Goal</h2>
<p>It is a movie recommendation app for users, built using React.js and the YTS API, that includes movies with a rating higher than 8.8. I expect to learn how to create a React website with multiple pages that fetches data from separate APIs through this project.</p>
